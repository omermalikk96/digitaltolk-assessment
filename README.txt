## What makes it amazing code

1. PHPDocs added for each property and method. It made it easy to understand the expected parameter types and return types etc. 
2. The presence of a Base Repository with fundamental methods facilitates the extension of new repositories, promoting code reusability.
3. Many (though not all) PSR rules have been followed, such as adhering to class, method, and property naming conventions, maintaining 4-space indentation, utilizing type hinting (via PHPDoc), and more.

## What makes it ok code

1. Returns types are mixed for all methods in BookingController, it should be the actual response type that will be returned.
2. Accessors (e.g. getModel) in the BaseRepository
    
## What makes it terrible code

1. Having too many methods in a controller can slow down the application because PHP needs to read the whole class every time it runs a method. So, it's better to stick to the seven CRUD methods according to Laravel standards.
2. Single responsibilty pattern was not followed which states each class should be responsible for only single task.
3. The Repository file is bloated with too many lines of code and is not recommended as well as it is not maintainable neither readable.
4. Extra variable declared that are not being used. e.g. `$affectedRows` and `$old_status` in the controller/repository.
5. `env` directly call in the controller 
6. PSR standards are not followed in code. For example the curly braces should be on the same line with the if-else statments.
7. All update or store requests in the code lack proper server-side validation, which creates a security vulnerability.
8. Return Types and type hinting was not consistently followed.
9. Variable naming convention was not consistent and were not meaningful.
10. There was a lot of commented code, we have git for mainting code history/version.

## How would I have done it

1. I've refactored the BookingController and have created separate controllers for jobs related code.
2. I've refactored the bookingRepository code as well and created a separate repository for job while there were some methods which were being used in both so i have created a sample way of doing it using traits for reusability rather than code duplication following DRY principle.
3. I've created some user model just to add some methods. It's to show that instead of duplicting same code again and again we can puth methods inside models and just call those methods.
4. There was another better way to do it but it was time taking for example not using repository pattern and instead we could have used service pattern and move the code from the controller to actions which are responsible for execution of single task, this approach makes the code easy to maintain.
5. Laravel Form reuqest for store and update should be added.
6. Instead of calling env we should use config for security reasons. 

##unit Test
1. I have written some tests for the method willExpireAt.
